The JavaScript Pacman code incorporates robust collision detection algorithms, enabling the Pacman character to elegantly bounce off the boundaries of the window screen, ensuring smooth and realistic gameplay. This implementation demonstrates proficient handling of edge cases and enhances the user experience by maintaining the Pacman's trajectory within the confines of the game window.
